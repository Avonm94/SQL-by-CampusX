What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating data in relational databases. 
It allows you to insert, update, retrieve, and delete data in a database. 
It is widely used for data management in many applications, websites, and businesses. In simple terms, SQL is used to communicate with and control databases.


Data Integrity:

Data integrity in databases refers to the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of the data stored in a database. 
It is a measure of the reliability and trustworthiness of the data and ensures that the data in a database is protected from errors, corruption, or unauthorized changes.
There are various methods used to ensure data integrity.

Constraints: Constraints in databases are rules or conditions that must be met for data to be inserted, updated, or deleted in a database table. 
             They are used to enforce the integrity of the data stored in a database and to prevent data from becoming inconsistent or corrupted.

Transactions: a sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work.

Normalization: a design technique that minimizes data redundancy and ensures data consistency by organizing data into separate tables.
